# Classification
Supervised Machine Learning -- Classification:

1) Loan Approval (German_Credit_Loan_Approval): <br>
Logistic regression has been leveraged to identify the probability of defaulting on a loan for clients of a certain German bank,
using parameters such as size of their checking and saving accounts, credit amount, job and housing status as predictors. <br>
Key tools: Logistic Regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves <br>
Libraries: statsmodels.api, statsmodels.stats, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

2) Risk Analytics of Loan Delinquency (Loan_Delinquent_Prediction): <br>
Decision-tree-based classification has been utilized to develop an ML-based model, capable of separating customers with the 
high risk of delinquency from the others. The model has then been optimized using pre-pruning and post-pruning techniques. <br>
Key tools: Decision Trees, pruning, cost-complexity pruning approach <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

1) Reservation Status (INNHotels): <br>
Classification strategies have been deployed to help a hotel chain reduce the cost of last-minute cancellations. In order to do
so, guests and reservation attributes such as room price, number of booked nights, time of arrival, special requests, meal plan,
etc. have been used to construct optimized logistic regression models and decision trees that are capable of accurately 
identifying the customers with high chance of cancellation. <br>
Key tools: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, hyperparameter tuning <br>
Libraries: statsmodels.api, statsmodels.stats, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

1) Spam Detection of Text Messages (Ham_Spam_Identifier): <br>
Support vector machines and naive Bayes algorithm have been leveraged to develop classifiers capable of deciding whether
a text message is spam or not. The models have been optimized using hyperparameter tuning, and the final models
have been productionized using scikit-learn pipeline. <br>
Key tools: Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF Vectorization), Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes Classifers, hyperparameter tuning <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, scikit-learn.feature_extraction, scikit-learn.pipeline, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
